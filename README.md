I'm developing on MacOS currently so do not have access to Visual Studio. I'm also not willing to pay for JetBrains Rider which is one of the recommended alternatives. Plan to go as far as I can with my current editor (VSCodium) and the dotnet cli. I'll switch to VSCode if necessary, as the C# Dev Kit extension is not open source and is unavailable on VSCode forks.
